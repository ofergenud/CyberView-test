# React/Mobx

## Task 1

Create a User Model in React.

## Task 1 Details

- User Model should contain at least `Age` and `Name` properties.
- Ensure you have utilizing MobX reactivity decorators.
- A starter file is located at `~/src/models.User.model.ts`.

## Task 2

Create a `CurrentUserStore` that uses the `UserModel` type you just wrote in Task 1.

- A starter file is located at `~/src/stores/CurrentUser.store.ts`.

## Task 3

- Create two React components: `EditUser` and `DisplayUsername`.
- The components should be displayed, side by side, in the `App.tsx` component.

## Task 3 Details

## `EditUser`

- On component load, if no user information alrady exists, query this API `https://randomuser.me/api` and display some of the user's information.
- Create button that calls the API without refreshing the page.
- Component should allow editing of user's name and age.
- Store current user information in browser local storage. Load information on page load, if exists.
- Create button to clear all user information.

## `DisplayUsername`

Component should display the user's username.

- Username = user.name + user.age (Example: Eric30, Moshe25, Chaim42)
- Only the first 10 chars of a name should be displayed in the username, but the full name should be saved (even longer than 10 chars).
- Ensure that the first letter of the username is capital, and that rest of the letter are lowercase.
- Changes in the user's name and age should be automatically reflected in this component utilizing MobX reactivity.
